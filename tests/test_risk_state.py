"""HMM risk-state sanity: it must recover a known synthetic HMM and never look ahead.

Mirrors the LPPLS discipline (recover a synthetic ground truth → a found signal is the model
working, not a fitting artifact). The no-look-ahead test is the load-bearing one for an HMM: it
proves the walk-forward signal at date t is invariant to data after t.
