"""Solver-quality benchmark: exact vs simulated annealing vs QAOA on the portfolio QUBO (§15.1).

The honest question for the quantum track: *does the quantum solver actually work, and how does it
scale* — measured as optimality gap vs the exact optimum, plus runtime, across instance sizes. This
is a solver benchmark, NOT a claim that quantum improves portfolio returns (that needs a walk-forward
backtest of the strategy). Writes a committable report. Requires the quantum extra:

    uv run --extra quantum python scripts/quantum_benchmark.py
