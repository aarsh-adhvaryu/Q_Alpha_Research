"""Daily AI market brief — an LLM *narrative* layer (Ops Layer PR-4). **Context only, never a signal.**

**Honest framing (load-bearing, do not weaken):** this is a language-model *narrative* — market
context for a human to read, nothing more. It never computes a number, never feeds the deterministic
advisor/engine, and never changes an allocation (the repo's iron rule: no new alpha without
validation). Any discretionary idea it surfaces — **including the "likely reaction" read** (a
qualitative near-term directional lean the model reasons out from the day's drivers) — is explicitly
the model's *non-validated opinion* for the existing **satellite sleeve** (the container built for
human judgment calls, ≤8% sleeve / ≤2.5% per name), never a forecast the system trusts or acts on.
Every brief opens with a "context only, not a signal" line so it can never be mistaken for the
validated system's output. It lives in the *research* repo precisely so the product stays
deterministic and LLM-free.

**Model:** Anthropic **Claude Haiku 4.5** with the server-side **web-search tool**, so the brief
reflects *today's* news without any RSS plumbing (Haiku was chosen over Opus deliberately — the brief
is context-only, so provider capability has nowhere to propagate; a templated news digest doesn't need
Opus-tier reasoning). Haiku is an older-tier model, so it uses the basic ``web_search_20250305`` tool
variant; thinking/effort don't apply to Haiku and a news summary needs neither, so both are omitted.
The single networked call is isolated behind an injectable :data:`GenerateFn` seam; everything else
here (:func:`build_prompt`, :func:`format_for_telegram`, parsing) is pure and unit-tested with no
network and no SDK installed.

**Fail-soft everywhere:** a missing ``ANTHROPIC_API_KEY``, an API/quota/refusal error, or an empty
response → skip (return ``None``) with a log line. The cron must never go red because the brief
hiccuped.
