"""Regime track — bubble / crash detection.

Held to the Q-Alpha iron rule (see ``PREREGISTRATION.md``): any usefulness claim must clear a bar
fixed *before* results, and must ultimately beat "always deploy" net of cost + tax. Wired to a
**deploy throttle + human alert only — never auto-sell** (selling realises tax; the asymmetry is the
whole point).
