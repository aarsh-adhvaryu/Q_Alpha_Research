"""hedge.py — the tax-free short-futures downside-protection overlay (promoted from research).

The one thing the research arc found that actually *minimises loss* in a crash: hold every share
(so **no capital-gains tax**, and you don't miss the recovery) and overlay a short index-futures
position, sized at ratio ``h`` of book value, while the systemic-stress gauge is elevated. It cut the
COVID drawdown ≈−25%→−10% on the validated book. ⚠️ **Not free, and an earlier version of this line
said "~no return given up" — the composite backtest measures otherwise.** Run continuously over
2013–2026 the gauge fires **18 times**, most of them not crashes, and you pay for every false alarm:
the overlay **cost 21.5% of terminal wealth to cut the worst fall from −34.0% to −23.4%**
(reports/PHASE4_BACKTEST.md §2a). Real insurance at a real premium. The cost is futures
transaction + monthly roll + **F&O business-income tax** on hedge gains (the honest India treatment).

*Why this and not "sell to go defensive":* selling appreciated equity to dodge a drawdown was tested
(the research HMM sell-overlay) and **lost** — the capital-gains tax outweighed the avoided loss,
because drawdowns mostly recover. The tax is always the killer; hedge, don't sell.

**No look-ahead (load-bearing):** ``hedge_active`` is a causal state machine over the gauge; the
position is lagged by ``execution_lag`` inside ``apply_futures_hedge`` (the gauge at t sets the
position carried into t+1). This is the validated research module, brought into the product so the
auto-pilot can forward-test the protection on fake money. **It never places a real F&O trade.**
